								<b>What are stealth accounts?</b>
								<p>Stealth accounts originate from eBay Stealth, the step-by-step guide to getting back on eBay and PayPal. It was created several years ago by aspkin. We base all our accounts on the methods taught in the eBay Stealth. You do not need to have read eBay Stealth before purchasing an account, we include our own quick start guide.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="b-faq-item">
								<b>What is included with my purchase?</b>
								<p>All of our packages include an eBay & PayPal account (All login details, VCC information and SIM card at your request) along with our ‘Quick Start Guide’. The ‘Quick Start Guide’ walks you step-by-step how to safely use your account and get back to selling quickly. While the quick start guide is included with your purchase, it’s very important to understand eBay Stealth before logging into your account. With eBay Stealth you'll learn how to prevent eBay from linking your accounts, how to increase your seller limits, how to overcome suspensions and even how to create your own accounts. That said, our quick start guide includes everything you need to know to use your account safely and successfully.</p>

							<div class="b-faq-item">
								<b>Can i start selling 1000 items today?</b>
								<p>While you may have purchased an account with 1000 item monthly limit, it’s not possible to sell to these limits within the first 90-days. The first 90-days is a probationary period for eBay and PayPal where if you sell high risk items, list too many items from the start or do anything fishy, your account will be manually reviewed and possibly limited. Instead you will want to start with low risk items (clothing, books, and toys work very well) and build up listings weekly. We recommend low-risk, auction style for as long as possible (NO​ ​ITEMS​ ​WITH​ ​MULTIPLE​ ​QUANTITIES​). Gradually mix in higher-risk items and work your way up to regular selling. The goal is to survive past 90 days. This means growth cannot explode. Our Quick Start guide goes in depth about our listing recommendations.</p>

							<div class="b-faq-item">
								<b>Do i need a new ip address?</b>
								<p>Yes, the easiest and best method is to purchase a fresh dedicated IP address from IPBurger. If you are local, you can manually change your IP address or simply use a VPN. If you choose to use a VPN we can only guarantee your account if you use the recommended VPN Service Provider (IPBurger); any other service provider is not covered and is at your own risk.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="b-faq-item">
								<b>Do you guarantee my account?</b>
								<p>We guarantee that your account is in excellent condition when delivered to you or we will replace your account. While we do not offer refunds, we do stand behind our product quality and will replace or mitigate any MC999 suspension within 30-days of your purchase. It is absolutely crucial to follow our quick-start guide when working with your account in order to protect your account. If your account is suspended due to your actions, we will still offer support but we cannot offer guarantees if you did not follow our instructions and were suspended as a result. We will not replace accounts that go down due to selling high-risk or counterfeit items.</p>
